Conversational AI Chatbot with a Knowledge Base
This project demonstrates a conversational AI chatbot built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The chatbot is designed to answer questions based on a specific, private knowledge base provided as a PDF document. This showcases the ability to create intelligent systems that can process and understand information from a custom source.

Features ‚ú®
Custom Knowledge Base: Uses a local PDF file as the source of all information.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Implements a full RAG pipeline to retrieve relevant information before generating a response, which helps prevent the model from "hallucinating."

Vector Search: Utilizes a vector database (FAISS) to perform fast and efficient semantic searches for relevant document chunks.

Instruction-Tuned Model: Uses a fine-tuned, open-source large language model (google/flan-t5-base) to generate coherent and context-aware answers.

Conversational Interface: Provides a simple command-line interface for natural language interaction.

Core Components üß©
This project is built using a modern AI engineering stack:

LangChain: A framework for building LLM applications, used to orchestrate the entire RAG pipeline.

Hugging Face Transformers: Provides access to the open-source embedding and large language models.

FAISS: A library from Facebook AI for efficient similarity search, acting as our vector database.

PyPDF2: A Python library for extracting text from PDF documents.

Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To set up this project, you will need a PDF file to use as your knowledge base. Ensure your virtual environment is active before running the commands.

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/AdamKBetts/ai-projects.git
cd ai-projects/chatbot-with-knowledge-base
Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install langchain-community langchain-huggingface faiss-cpu pypdf2 transformers
Add your PDF: Place your chosen PDF file in this directory and rename it to knowledge_base.pdf.

Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
With your virtual environment active and your knowledge_base.pdf in place, run the rag_bot.py script.

Bash

python rag_bot.py
The first time you run the script, it will download the necessary models from Hugging Face and process your PDF. This may take a few minutes. Once the process is complete, you can start asking questions based on the content of your PDF.

To exit the chatbot, simply type exit and press Enter.

Customization ‚öôÔ∏è
You can easily customize the chatbot's behavior by adjusting a few parameters in rag_bot.py:

chunk_size: In the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter section, you can modify the chunk_size to control how large the text segments are.

search_kwargs: In the new_vectorstore.as_retriever line, you can change the k value to adjust how many document chunks the chatbot retrieves to answer each question. A smaller number makes the bot more concise, while a larger number provides more context.
