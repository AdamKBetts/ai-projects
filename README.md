# AI Engineering Portfolio

## A. Introduction

Welcome to my AI Engineering Portfolio! This repository showcases my hands-on experience in building, training, and deploying a variety of AI models and applications. Each project is a self-contained demonstration of a key concept in artificial intelligence, ranging from traditional computer vision to modern large language models.

My projects highlight proficiency in the following areas:

- **Python Programming** and **Software Development**
- **Computer Vision** (Object Detection, Image Captioning)
- **Natural Language Processing** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Fine-Tuning, Text Summarization)
- **Multimodal AI** (Vision-Language Models)
- **Reinforcement Learning** (Agent-Based Systems)
- **Data Ingestion** (Working with APIs and real-time data)
- **Model Deployment** and **MLOps** (Flask and Streamlit Web Apps)
- **Hugging Face Ecosystem** (Transformers, PEFT, Datasets)
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control

## B. Projects

### 1. Object Detection and Analysis Tool

**Technologies:** `TensorFlow`, `OpenCV`
**Description:** A computer vision project that detects objects in images and videos, providing real-time analysis.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

**Technologies:** `LangChain`, `Hugging Face`, `FAISS`
**Description:** An advanced NLP project that builds a custom chatbot capable of answering questions based on your own documents, going beyond the knowledge of its base model.

### 3. Image Captioning and Analysis Tool

**Technologies:** `Hugging Face Transformers`, `BLIP`
**Description:** A multimodal AI application that generates a descriptive natural language caption for any given image, demonstrating a model's ability to understand both visual and text data.

### 4. Interactive Image Captioning Web App

**Technologies:** `Flask`, `Hugging Face`
**Description:** A model deployment project that transforms a local AI script into a user-friendly web application, showcasing the principles of MLOps.

### 5. Personalized Large Language Model (LLM)

**Technologies:** `Hugging Face Transformers`, `PEFT`, `LoRA`
**Description:** A deep dive into fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on a custom dataset, demonstrating how to adapt a general-purpose model for a specialized task.

### 6. Reinforcement Learning Game Agent

**Technologies:** `Gymnasium`, `Numpy`
**Description:** An introduction to Reinforcement Learning where an AI agent learns to play a simple game from scratch using the Q-Learning algorithm.

### 7. Real-time News Summarization Dashboard

**Technologies:** `Streamlit`, `NewsAPI`, `Hugging Face`
**Description:** An end-to-end AI application that fetches live news articles from a public API, performs AI-driven text summarization, and displays the results on an interactive web dashboard.
