# Project 5: Personalized Large Language Model (LLM)

This project demonstrates how to **fine-tune a pre-trained Large Language Model** to adapt its behavior to a specific task or dataset. It utilizes a cutting-edge technique called **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** with **LoRA**, which allows for efficient training without the need for a powerful GPU or a massive dataset. This is a crucial skill for customizing general-purpose models for specialized applications.

### Features ‚ú®

- **LLM Fine-Tuning:** Trains a foundational LLM on a custom text dataset.
- **Efficient Training:** Uses **PEFT** to reduce computational costs, making the process accessible.
- **Custom Model Creation:** The fine-tuning process creates a personalized version of the model tailored to your data.
- **Scalable Approach:** The techniques used here are the foundation for building highly specialized AI models for enterprise applications.

### Core Components üß©

- **Hugging Face `transformers`:** Provides the base LLM and the training API.
- **`peft` (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning):** The library that enables efficient model customization.
- **`datasets`:** Used for handling and preparing the text data for training.
- **`accelerate`:** A library that helps manage the training process, especially on different hardware.

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd llm-fine-tuning
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install transformers peft accelerate datasets
    ```

### Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1.  **Add your custom data:**
    The script uses a simple text file named `dummy_data.txt`. You can replace its content with your own custom data. The more data you provide, the better the model will be at learning the new information.

2.  **Run the fine-tuning script:**
    ```bash
    python finetune_llm.py
    ```
    The script will download the base model and then begin the training process. Once complete, it will print a confirmation message.
